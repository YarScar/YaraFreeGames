Purpose/Problem Statement - My program is a simulated website that guides users through the experience of creating an account, logging in, and connecting with a friend who also uses the site. While it doesn't feature real games, it mimics the interface and flow of a gaming platform to demonstrate how user interaction and account-based features work.

Target Audience - This is designed for students and young people who are interested in learning how websites and user interaction systems work, especially those curious about gaming platforms or account-based web experiences.

Solution + Limitations - My project simulates how a gaming website works by letting users create accounts, log in, and find friends. It helps demonstrate user interaction, but it doesnâ€™t include real games or live connections; just the interface and basic flow.

Key Features / Key Components - I used random user API. Users can create an account, log in, view a homepage, and simulate finding a friend on the platform. The program focuses on mimicking the layout and flow of a gaming website. I also added Try and Except blocks to my code in order to make it efficient and not run into any errors.

Technical Challenges + Future Plans - It was challenging to simulate user interactions realistically. With more time, I would add actual game sprites. I built the project step by step by starting with the layout, then login features, and finally the friend option.

Tools and Resources Used - I used TechSmart, Random User, a Google Doc for planning, and comments in my code to stay organized and focused.
